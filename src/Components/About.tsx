            On this page you can find out what I have been up to lately and
            maybe even a little bit about where I will go in the future. For me,
            the greatest thing about being a musician is being in the position
            to inspire other people. I take such pleasure in hearing that people
            have been motivated to create after hearing my music, whether it be
            a painting, a poem, their own music or something completely
            different. Music is not a one way street, it is a conversation where
            the listener's role is as important as the artist's. Well, here you
            can find my side of it all.
